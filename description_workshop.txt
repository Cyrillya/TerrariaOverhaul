- A vastly superior & open sourced codebase;
- Reimagined and more vanilla-faithful, while also more crazy, solid and fun game design;
- Magnitudes more overall quality assurance & polishing.
- Near flawless compatibility with content mods, to be polished further soon.

This seems to occur when using [b]Subtle[/b] Frameskip together with the [b]HighFpsSupport[/b] mod.
Navigate to the vanilla Video settings and set Frameskip to [b]Off[/b].
